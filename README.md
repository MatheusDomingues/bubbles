Please leave your comments, feedback and feature ideas on the document (soon we can make a Bubble for that kind of thing ðŸ˜„ )

## Up and running

First, install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```
Then run your migrations to dabase (heroku for now)

```bash
yarn migrate:up
```
Then, start your development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Database
You can start the database locally by using
```
docker-compose up
```
To tell Docker-Compose to destroy the volumes and its data, you need to use:
```
docker-compose down --volumes
```

## Prisma
To map your data model to the database schema, you need to use the prisma migrate
```bash
npx prisma migrate save --name "name-of-the-migration" --experimental
yarn migrate:up
```
